    "\n",
    "In this question the goal is to perform exact probabilistic inference for the number of rolls. Rather than simulating the game and recording the number of moves you will need to compute systematically the probabilities of every possible sequence of rolls. You should use the simplified version of board movement with no snakes and ladders and the simple landing rule. As an example let's consider a very short board of 4 squares. The only sequence of 1 roll that finishes the game is rolling a 4 which has $P(4) = 1/6$. For two rolls we have more possibilities such as 1,3 or 3,1 or 2,2 or 2,3 or 3,2 etc. For example the probability of (1,3) is $P(1,3) = 1/6 * 1/6$. Your code should systematically calculate the right products and sums to come up with probabilities for \n",
    "each possible number of rolls. To make this a bit simpler consider a board of length $25$. I advise that you first start by looking at very short boards and checking some of the calculations by hand. \n",
