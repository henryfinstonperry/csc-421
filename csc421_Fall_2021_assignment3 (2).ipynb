    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the topics covered in **Chapter 12 - Quantifying Uncertainty **, **Chapter 13 Probabilistic Reasoning** from the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.*  You are welcome and actually it can be educational to look at the code at the aima-code repository as well as other code resources you can find on the web. However, make sure you understand any code that you incoporate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment structure is as follows - each item is worth 1 point: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Snakes and ladder simulation (Basic) - basic rolling and movement simulation, no ladders/snakes \n",
    "2. Snakes and ladder simulation (Basic) - multiple simulations and recording of number of rolls \n",
    "3. Snakes and ladder simulation (Expected) - adding of user-specified ladders/snakes \n",
    "4. Snakes and ladder simulation (Expected) - simulation to determine probability distribution of number of rolls \n",
    "5. Snakes and ladder simulation (Advanced) - exact inference + simulation with different ending rules \n",
    "6. Naive Bayes text classsification (Basic) - conditional probabilities for dictionary words \n",
    "7. Naive Bayes text classification (Basic) - markdown equations for Bernoulli \n",
    "8. Naive Bayes text classification (Expected) - prediction of movie review polarity \n",
    "9. Naive Bayes text classification (Expected) - classification accuracy and confusion matrix \n",
    "10. Naive Bayes text classification (Advanced) - probabilitistic generation of movie reviews \n",

    "The grading will be done in 0.5 increments. 1 point for correct answer, 0.5 points for partial or incorrect \n",

    "multiple times until the sum of rolls is larger or equal to the length of the board.  (note: \n",
    "this is one of the possible and simplest end rules). The function should return the total \n",

    "Your next task is to collect information about the probability distribution of number of rolls using the *play_game* function you implemented in the previous subquestion. Simulate playing the game 1000 times with a board length of 100 and record the number of rolls for each simulation. Show the histogram of the number of rolls for this simulation. You don't need to plot the histogram but can simply show the counts for each number of rolls as text. You can also create a plot using either the *matplotlib* or *bokeh* plotting frameworks. Make sure you include appropriate pip install and import statements in your notebook and check that it works in the Jupyterhub of the course. \n",

    "# QUESTION 5 (ADVANCED) - 1 point \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question the goal is to perform exact probabilistic inference for the number of rolls. Rather than simulating the game and recording the number of moves you will need to compute systematically the probabilities of every possible sequence of rolls. You should use the simplified version of board movement with no snakes and ladders and the simple landing rule. As an example let's consider a very short board of 4 squares. The only sequence of 1 roll that finishes the game is rolling a 4 which has $P(4) = 1/6$. For two rolls we have more possibilities such as 1,3 or 3,1 or 2,2 or 2,3 or 3,2 etc. For example the probability of (1,3) is $P(1,3) = 1/6 * 1/6$. Your code should systematically calculate the right products and sums to come up with probabilities for \n",
    "each possible number of rolls. To make this a bit simpler consider a board of length $25$. I advise that you first start by looking at very short boards and checking some of the calculations by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the results you get from exact inference with the results you get from approximate inference for the same board length. "
