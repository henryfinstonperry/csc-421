These activities take place in particular locations such as Restaurant A and Restaurant B or Gym A, Gym B and each particular location can be thought of as a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of location points. If you consider the activity as the hidden state and the location as the observation you have a Hidden Markov Model.
